Model name: The Alien
Collection: "Space Squad 2010"
File format: .3ds
Faces: 13591
Vertices: 6791
Textures: all included in 3d-Studio R4
Characteristics: This is a mesh I used for a short 3d animation called "Space
Squad 2010". I know it isn't very detailed, but that's becouse I wanted to
make it quickly and to spend less time rendering.
It represents Boggie, the alien member of the squad.
